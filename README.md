# DWGLayersExporter

Export Illustrator Layers and/or Artboards as PNGs and PDFs - https://www.ericson.net/content/2011/06/export-illustrator-layers-andor-artboards-as-pngs-and-pdfs/?fbclid=IwAR2Q7DJN1SF_QDJGvOw1R6mRAG02hMoiJ1HjIkprRUCJUOFsJeyO3QaW9Gg

To retain IDEN layers while exporting DWG layers, an addition if clause has been added to the hide_all_layers function block.

(As much as it is simple, for beginners like me with no clue about jsx in the start but has to work with DWG diagrams, it should make life simpler)
